# Expense-report
Dropwizard service for keeping track on [IOU's] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOU). This initial commit contains the skeleton of what in the future will be a service with the following:
- Create users
- Create events
- Add users/participants to event
- Participants add their expenses
  - Expenses can be in EUR/SEK/HRK
  - Currency will be converted with the exchange rate for the date of the purchase
  - Expenses can be split between multiple participants
- Reports are generated containing how much each participant spent
